name=sect2>Description </A></H2>
<P><I>Espresso</I> takes as input a two-level representation of a two-valued (or 
multiple-valued) Boolean function, and produces a minimal equivalent 
representation. The algorithms used are new and represent an advance in both 
speed and optimality of solution in heuristic Boolean minimization. 
<P><I>Espresso</I> reads the <I>file </I>provided (or standard input if no files 
are specified), performs the minimization, and writes the minimized result to 
standard output. <I>Espresso</I> automatically verifies that the minimized 
function is equivalent to the original function. Options allow for using an 
exact minimization algorithm, for choosing an optimal phase assignment for the 
output functions, and for choosing an optimal assignment of the inputs to input 
decoders. 
<P>The default input and output file formats are compatible with the Berkeley 
standard format for the physical description of a <FONT size=-1>PLA</FONT> . The 
input format is described in detail in <A 
href="http://bear.ces.cwru.edu/eecs_cad/man_octtools_espresso_inputs.html">espresso(5)</A> 
. Note that the input file is a <I>logical </I>representation of a set of 
Boolean equations, and hence the input format differs slightly from that 
described in <A 
href="http://bear.ces.cwru.edu/eecs_cad/man_octtools_pla.html">pla(5)</A> (which 
provides for the <I>physical </I>representation of a <FONT size=-1>PLA</FONT> ). 
The input and output formats have been expanded to allow for multiple-valued 
logic functions, and to allow for the specification of the don't-care set which 
will be used in the minimization. 
<P>A complete list of the command line options is given below. Be warned that 
many of the command line options are not intended for general use. 
<DL>
  <DT><B>-d</B> 
  <DD>Enables debugging. Useful only for those familiar with the algorithms 
  used. 
  <DT><B>-Dcheck</B> 
  <DD>Checks that the function is a partition of the entire space (i.e., that 
  the <FONT size=-1>ON</FONT> -set, <FONT size=-1>OFF</FONT> -set and <FONT 
  size=-1>DC</FONT> -set are pairwise disjoint, and that their union is the 
  Universe). 
  <DT><B>-Dd1merge</B> 
  <DD>Performs a quick distance-1 merge on the input file. This is useful when 
  the input file is very large (e.g., a truth table with more than 1000 terms) 
  because distance-1 merge is O(n log n) rather than the <FONT 
  size=-1>EXPAND</FONT> step of Espresso which is O(n * n). The output should 
  then be run through Espresso to complete the minimization. A range of 
  variables to be merged can also be specified using <B>-rn-m</B> (the default 
  is to merge over all variables). 
  <DT><B>-Decho</B> 
  <DD>Echoes the function to standard output. This can be used to get the 
  complement of a function when combined with <B>-o </B>. 
  <DT><B>-Dequiv</B> 
  <DD>Identify output variables which are equivalent. Takes into account the 
  don't-care set and checks for equivalence of both the <FONT size=-1>ON</FONT> 
  -set and <FONT size=-1>OFF</FONT> -set. 
  <DT><B>-Dexact</B> 
  <DD>Exact minimization algorithm (guarantees minimum number of product terms, 
  and heuristically minimizes number of literals). Potentially expensive. 
  <DT><B>-Dmany</B> 
  <DD>Reads and minimizes PLA's until end-of-file is detected. PLA's in the same 
  file are separated by <I>.e </I>. 
  <DT><B>-Dmap</B> 
  <DD>Draw the Karnaugh maps for a binary-valued function. 
  <DT><B>-Dmapdc</B> 
  <DD>Derive from the binary-valued variable <I>DONT_CARE </I>a don't-care set, 
  and then delete this variable. All input conditions for which an output 
  changes when <I>DONT_CARE </I>changes define the don't-care conditions for 
  that output. This is a hack to support don't-cares from high-level languages 
  without a notion of don't-cares. 
  <DT><B>-Dopo</B> 
  <DD>Perform output phase optimization (i.e., determine which functions to 
  complement to reduce the number of terms needed to implement the function). 
  After choosing an assignment of phases for the outputs, the function is 
  minimized. A simple algorithm is used which may become very expensive for a 
  large number of outputs (e.g., more than 40). 
  <DT><B>-Dopoall</B> 
  <DD>Minimize the function with all possible phase assignments. A range of 
  outputs to cycle through can be given with <B>-rn-m</B> (the default is to use 
  all outputs). The option <B>-S1</B> will perform an exact minimization for 
  each phase assignment. Be warned that opoall requires an exponential number of 
  minimizations ! 
  <DT><B>-Dpair</B> 
  <DD>Choose an assignment of the inputs to two-bit decoders, and minimize the 
  function. The function MUST be minimized first to achieve good results. There 
  are actually 4 different algorithms, of increasing cost, which may be selected 
  with <B>-S1</B>, <B>-S2</B>, or <B>-S3</B>. The default is <B>-S0</B> which 
  seems to give the best results for the cost. 
  <DT><B>-Dpairall</B> 
  <DD>Minimize the function with all possible assignments of inputs to two-bit 
  decoders. The option <B>-S1</B> will perform an exact minimization for each 
  assignment of inputs to decoders, and the option <B>-S2</B> will perform an 
  output-phase assignment for each assignment of inputs to decoders. Be warned 
  that pairall requires an exponential number of minimizations ! 
  <DT><B>-Dseparate</B> 
  <DD>Remove the don't-care set from the <FONT size=-1>ON</FONT> -set of the 
  function. 
  <DT><B>-Dso</B> 
  <DD>Minimize each function one at a time as a single-output function. Terms 
  will not be shared among the functions. The option <B>-S1</B> will perform an 
  exact minimization for each single-output function. 
  <DT><B>-Dso_both</B> 
  <DD>Minimize each function one at a time as a single-output function, but 
  choose the function or its complement based on which has fewer terms. The 
  option <B>-S1</B> will perform an exact minimization for each single-output 
  function and its complement to determine which has fewer terms. 
  <DT><B>-Dstats</B> 
  <DD>Provide simple statistics on the size of the function. 
  <DT><B>-Dverify</B> 
  <DD>Checks for Boolean equivalence of two PLA's. Reads two filenames from the 
  command line, each containing a single PLA. 
  <DT><B>-DPLAverify</B> 
  <DD>Checks for Boolean equivalence of two PLA's by first permuting the columns 
  based on the user supplied variable names. Reads two filenames from the 
  command line. 
  <DT><B>-eeat</B> 
  <DD>Normally comments are echoed from the input file to the output file. This 
  options discards any comments in the input file. 
  <DT><B>-efast</B> 
  <DD>Stop after the first <FONT size=-1>EXPAND</FONT> and <FONT 
  size=-1>IRREDUNDANT</FONT> operations (i.e., do not iterate over the 
  solution). 
  <DT><B>-ekiss</B> 
  <DD>Sets up a <I>kiss </I>-style minimization problem. This is a hack. 
  <DT><B>-eness</B> 
  <DD>Essential primes will not be detected. 
  <DT><B>-enirr</B> 
  <DD>The result will not necessarily be made irredundant in the final step 
  which removes redundant literals. 
  <DT><B>-enunwrap</B> 
  <DD>The <FONT size=-1>ON</FONT> -set will not be unwrapped before beginning 
  the minimization. 
  <DT><B>-eonset</B> 
  <DD>Recompute the <FONT size=-1>ON</FONT> -set before the minimization. Useful 
  when the <FONT size=-1>PLA</FONT> has a large number of product terms (e.g., 
  an exhaustive list of minterms). 
  <DT><B>-epos</B> 
  <DD>Swaps the <FONT size=-1>ON</FONT> -set and <FONT size=-1>OFF</FONT> -set 
  of the function after reading the function. This can be used to minimize the 
  <FONT size=-1>OFF</FONT> -set of a function. <I>.phase </I>(see <A 
  href="http://bear.ces.cwru.edu/eecs_cad/man_octtools_espresso_inputs.html">espresso(5)</A> 
  ) in the input file can also specify an arbitrary choice of output phases. 
  <DT><B>-estrong</B> 
  <DD>Uses the alternate strategy <FONT size=-1>SUPER_GASP</FONT> (as a 
  replacement for <FONT size=-1>LAST_&nbsp;GASP</FONT> ) which is more 
  expensive, but occasionally provides better results. 
  <DT><B>-o[type]</B> 
  <DD>Selects the output format. By default, only the <FONT size=-1>ON</FONT> 
  -set (i.e., type f) is output after the minimization. [type] can be one of 
  <B>f </B>, <B>d </B>, <B>r </B>, <B>fd </B>, <B>dr </B>, <B>fr </B>, or <B>fdr 
  </B>to select any combination of the <FONT size=-1>ON</FONT> -set (f), the 
  <FONT size=-1>OFF</FONT> -set (r) or the <FONT size=-1>DC</FONT> -set (d). 
  [type] may also be <B>eqntott </B>to output algebraic equations acceptable to 
  <I><A 
  href="http://bear.ces.cwru.edu/eecs_cad/eqntott.1OCTTOOLS">eqntott</I>(1OCTTOOLS)</A> 
  ,<I></I> or <B>pleasure </B>to output an unmerged <FONT size=-1>PLA</FONT> 
  (with the <I>.label </I>and <I>.group </I>keywords) acceptable to <I><A 
  href="http://bear.ces.cwru.edu/eecs_cad/pleasure.1OCTTOOLS">pleasure</I>(1OCTTOOLS)</A> 
  . 
  <DT><B>-s</B> 
  <DD>Will provide a short summary of the execution of the program including the 
  initial cost of the function, the final cost, and the computer resources used. 

  <DT><B>-t</B> 
  <DD>Will produce a trace showing the execution of the program. After each main 
  step of the algorithm, a single line is printed which reports the processor 
  time used, and the current cost of the function. 
  <DT><B>-x</B> 
  <DD>Suppress printing of the solution. 
  <DT><B>-v [type]</B> 
  <DD>Specifies verbose debugging detail. Not generally useful. </DD></DL>
<H2><A href="http://bear.ces.cwru.edu/eecs_cad/man_octtools_espresso.html#toc3" 
name=sect3>Diagnostics </A></H2>Espresso will issue a warning message if a 
product term spans more than one line. Usually this is an indication that the 
number of inputs or outputs of the function is specified incorrectly.

name=sect6>Comments </A></H2>Default is to pass comments and unrecognized 
options from the input file to standard output (sometimes this isn't what you 
want). 
<P>It is no longer possible to specify the type on the command line. 
<P>There are a lot of options, but typical use doesn't need them. 
<P>This manual page refers to Version 2.3 of Espresso. The major change from 
Version 2.2 to Version 2.3 is the addition of a fast sparse-matrix covering 
algorithm for the <B>-Dexact </B>mode. 
<P>The -Dopo option becomes very slow for many outputs (&gt; 20).
